# tidesdb-ts

tidesdb-ts is the official TypeScript binding for TidesDB.

TidesDB is a fast and efficient key-value storage engine library written in C. The underlying data structure is based on a log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree). This TypeScript binding provides a safe, idiomatic TypeScript interface to TidesDB with full support for all features.

## Features

- MVCC with five isolation levels from READ UNCOMMITTED to SERIALIZABLE
- Column families (isolated key-value stores with independent configuration)
- Bidirectional iterators with forward/backward traversal and seek support
- TTL (time to live) support with automatic key expiration
- LZ4, LZ4 Fast, ZSTD, Snappy, or no compression
- Bloom filters with configurable false positive rates
- Global block CLOCK cache for hot blocks
- Savepoints for partial transaction rollback
- Six built-in comparators plus custom registration
